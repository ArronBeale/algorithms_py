# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various sorting algorithms.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Usage

To run the Bubble Sort algorithm:

```bash
python main.py bubble_sort
```

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the subarray of items already sorted and the subarray of items remaining to be sorted. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted subarray and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted subarray.  

### Usage
To run the Selection Sort algorithm:
```bash
python main.py selection_sort
```  

## Future Algorithms
Below is a list of algorithms that I plan to implement in the future:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Shell Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
